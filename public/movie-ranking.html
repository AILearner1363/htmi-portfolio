<h1>Best movies as Nargis says</h1>
<h2>Top three this year</h2>
<hr /> 
<h3>Elvis</h3>
<p>
Astounding work once again by Baz Luhrmann. Extraordinary role dive by Austin butler. 
Beautiful and next to real set design. 
</p>
<h3>Poor Things</h3>
<p>
Theatrical, strange, purely animalistic but reveals how humans are like onions having many layers.
</p>
<h3>A man called Otto</h3>
<p>
Heartfelt. Truly shows the character through Tom Hanks' acting
